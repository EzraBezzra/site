	<h2>I like books</h2>
	<p>
		I have been trying to read more books, especially older, more well known classics. The following are the books 
		I have enjoyed the most:
		<li>To Kill A Mockingbird - by Harper Lee</li>
		<li>The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind - by Bryan Mealer and William Kamkwamba</li>

	</p>

	<h2>I like music</h2>
	<p>
		I have been listeining to a lot of Big Band Swing amongst other music. After I finished a video game, I would 
		listen to its sound tracks. I enjoyed haveing background music whlile working as long as it wasn't too 
		distracting. The following are some exelent musicans and their music:
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_kIViBEcys">Wycliffe Gordon</a></li>
